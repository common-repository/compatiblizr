Plugin for patching old versions of IE (7 and 8)to work with CSS3 selectors and Media Queries.

== Description ==

IE 7 and 8 don't do CSS3 or Media queries so instead of adding the fixes to your theme you can add them via a plugin. This means when they finally die a death you can drop support without having to update your theme. This also covers purchased themes so you don't need to alter the actual files.

== Installation ==


1. Upload the `compatiblizr` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Check the options that you would like to include in Settings > Compatiblizr
